        In August 2022, I received my MS in Marketing from Loyola University
        Chicago with a concentration in Integrated Marketing Communications. I
        graduated Summa Cum Laude and with Deanâ€™s Honors. In addition, I am
        continuing my education journey by studying to become a full-stack web
        developer. By August 2025, I will have completed the Certificate in Web
        Development from Fullstack Academy. Currently, I am a Digital
        Coordinator at a PR agency, Mainland, in Chicago, IL. If you have any
        questions, please feel free to reach out!
